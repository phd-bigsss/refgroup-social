## Data

::: {.incremental .highlight-last style="font-size: 120%;"}

- [ELSOC (COES)](https://coes.cl/elsoc/): representative panel of Chile's urban adult population, using probabilistic, stratified, cluster, and multistage sampling in large and small cities

- Period: three waves (2016, 2018 and, 2023)

- Attrition 2016→2023: ~ 40%

- Analytical sample (unbalanced 3 waves): 

    * **N = 6,562 observations**  nested in 
    * **N = 2,884  individuals**

## Methods

:::: {.incremental style="font-size: 110%;"}

**Fixed effects regression**:

- Panel structure: repeated observations nested within individuals

- within-person effects capture how changes in individual-level variables (e.g., network diversity) while controlling for the influence of time-invariant characteristics and time trends

- to account for non-linear relationships of network diversity $(\beta_1\mathrm{D}_{it})$, a quadratic term is included $({\beta_2\mathrm{D} }_{it}^2)$

- Equation:

::: {.fragment}
$$\begin{aligned}
    Y_{it}=\beta_0+\beta_1\mathrm{D}_{it}+{\beta_2\mathrm{D} }_{it}^2+\alpha_i+\tau_t+\varepsilon_{it} 
    \end{aligned}
    $$

In this study:

- The Cronbach alpha is close to 0.8 in all time points (α1 =.82, α2=.86, α3=.83)
- Single indicator based on the combination of the three items

> Higher values represent greater support for market justice.

“Now I will ask you about some of your **acquaintances**. It doesn't matter if they are close to you (family or friends) or not. A person is your acquaintance if you at least know their first name, and if you could have a conversation with them if you meet them on the street or in a shopping centre. 

Thinking only of people living in Chile, could you tell me, based on the following sheet and even approximately, how many people you know are...?”

1. None 
2. One 
3. Between 2 and 4 
4. Between 5 and 7 
5. Between 8 and 10 
6. Between 11 and 15 
7. 16 or more

Studies recommend using a single dimension to more accurately capture the network attribute [(Sapin et al., 2020;Otero & Mendoza, 2023)]{style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"}.

PCA*:

* **Extensivity** (1 – 13): degree of variety as the total number of known occupations.
* **Generalized Entropy** (0 – 1): degree of balance across groups based on the number of acquaintances in each occupation.

This strategy consider both the possible ties to the available occupations (Variety) and how these ties are distributed across each group (Balance) [(Koopmans & Schaeffer, 2015)]{style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"}. 

*Note: ~90% of explained variance
