* Individual changes in occupational status, showing that increasing the socioeconomic status has a negative but non-significant relationship with support for market justice preferences (β = -0.011, p>0.05). 

* One standard deviation increase in diversity drives a decrease of -0.067 in the market justice scale (β =-0.067, p<0.001).

* Robust to the inclusion of network size and network socioeconomic status

* When network diversity is at the 20th percentile, the average predicted market justice preference is 2.20 (95% CI: 2.12 – 2.28), and it decreases to 2.08 when it is at the 80th percentile (95% CI: 2.02 – 2.14). 

* According to the original scale (1 to 5) of the market justice preferences index, this difference represents a change of around 3%.
